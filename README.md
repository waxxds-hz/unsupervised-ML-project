# unsupervised-ML-project
## Clustering in astrophysical data -- pulsar stars
This project explores unsupervised machine learning algorithms in astrophysics data analysis, aiming to cluster and reveal underlying patterns of the data.
## Dataset
- Due to file size constraints, this repository includes smaller subsets of the HEPMASS dataset.
- The full dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HEPMASS).
## Files
- `Supervised_Learning_Final_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and model results.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
- `test_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for testing. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
- `train_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for training. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
