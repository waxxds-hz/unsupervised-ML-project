## Clustering in astrophysical data -- pulsar stars
This project explores unsupervised machine learning algorithms in astrophysical data analysis, aiming to cluster and reveal underlying patterns of the pulsar star data.
## Dataset
- Pulsar candidates are collected during the HTRU survey.
- The full dataset is available [here]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/372/htru2).
## Files
- `unsupervised_learning_final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and model results.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
- `test_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for testing. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
- `train_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for training. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
